Hi, my name is Gwen!

I work in cybersecurity with a focus on reducing risk through scalable design and repeatable practice - particularly across vulnerability management, configuration management, and application security.

Here, I write about my reflections and what I've learned over the years.

## Topics I'm exploring
- **Vulnerability management:** intake > prioritization > remediation SLAs > validation > metrics
- **Configuration management:** baselines, drift detection, secure by default principles, exception handling
- **Application security:** thread modeling, secure design reviews, SDLC quality gates, dependecy risk
- **Architecture + GRC:** control mapping, evidence strategy, risk acceptance decisions, governance workflows
- **General security topics:** ideas, lessons learned, and emerging issues that shape day to day security work
