Hi, my name is Gwen!

I work in cybersecurity with a focus on reducing risk through scalable design and repeatable practice, particularly across vulnerability management, configuration management, and application security. My current focus is exploring the connection between architecture and governance: how standards become implementable controls, how exceptions are evaluated, and how security decisions hold up under operational constraints.

## Topics I'm Exploring
- **Vulnerability management:** intake > prioritization > remediation SLAs > validation > metrics
- **Configuration management:** baselines, drift detection, secure by default principles, exception handling
- **Application security:** thread modeling, secure design reviews, SDLC quality gates, dependecy risk
- **Architecture + GRC:** control mapping, evidence strategy, risk acceptance decisions, governance workflows
- **General security topics:** ideas, lessons learned, and emerging issues that shape day to day security work
