I lived in Copenhagen from January to March, before returning home as COVID-19 spread quickly and countries began entering lockdown.

Even though my time was cut short, I still packed a lot into those three months:
- Studied innovation and entrepreneurship, with a computer science course load on the side
- Worked at a gaming startup, writing blog posts to improve SEO
- Volunteered at a beekeeping startup, helping with day-to-day work (including jarring honey)

Because I’d loaded up on credits during my freshman and sophomore years, I had room to branch out. I chose innovation and entrepreneurship courses while still keeping CS electives in the mix.

The **innovation and entrepreneurship** classes changed how I think about problem-solving. Instead of projecting your own assumptions onto customers, you learn to identify what they actually struggle with and how hard it is to ask the right questions to learn that.

My **CS electives** were just as memorable. I learned how procedural generation shows up in video games and why computers don’t generate truly random numbers (only pseudo-random ones). My group used Perlin Noise to build an Animal Crossing island generator ([INSERT LINK]). While learning about entropy, I also learned a little about how this applies to security and how unpredictability matters when you need strong random inputs. One of my favorite examples is how Cloudflare uses lava lamps to introduce randomness into their systems.

At the **gaming startup**, I got to work alongside people actively building a product and solving real problems in real time. The team was optimistic, creative, and genuinely excited about their work - some of the most passionate people I’d met. My role was writing SEO-focused posts to help their content perform better in search.

At the **beekeeping startup**, I learned how essential bees are to the environment while doing hands-on work like jarring honey. It also ended up being one of the most unexpectedly social parts of the experience because people from different backgrounds and countries were all in the same place, sharing stories about their cultures and careers.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of everything I did, but it captures a few highlights. Even though the semester ended early, my time in Copenhagen was a meaningful experience that I'll never forget.
