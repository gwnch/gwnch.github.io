excerpt: "Three of the most memorable books I read in 2024. Unsurprisingly, they're all non-fiction."

These were the most memorable books I read this year that will have a lasting impact on me going into the new year.

**The New Map by Daniel Yergin**

This read like a geopolitical briefing (not that I've received one, but what I imagine they're like). The core idea is that energy doesn't just fuel economies, it forms alliances, controls leverage, and sets conditions for conflict and cooperation quietly in the background. What I took away is how often news events are directly or indirectly tied to energy.

**Down the Drain by Julia Fox**

After reading this book, dating Kanye West was the least interesting thing about Julie Fox. This is her survival story and memoir of how she scraped her way through family life, relationships, and her identity. She writes in a candid and raw way that makes it a little uncomfortable, but hard to stop reading because her journey is so fascinating.

**The Biggest Bluff by Maria Konnikova**

A great book for anyone who wants to get better at thinking under uncertainty. You can make the right call and still lose (or the reverse happens). Unncertainty is a constant, not an exception. This book will change how you interpret wins and losses in work and life. It's practical and a slightly different format from a typical self help book.
