I passed the CCSK and here's my badge: [Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge v.5](https://www.credly.com/badges/a0e9e17b-f6b8-4841-8023-666cf2af2c42)

TLDR at the bottom.

## Why I took the CCSKv5
I wanted a vendor-agnostic cloud security credentials that would strengthen my fundamentals without locking me into a specific cloud vendor (AWS/Azure/GRP). The CCSK kept coming up as a solid first cert that covers common cloud security concepts and governance.

## What it’s actually like
The CCSK is very straightforward especially if you’ve already had exposure to cloud security. 

**Number of questions:** 60 
**Format:** multiple choice
**Duration:** 120 minutes (2 hours)
**Passing score:** 80%
**Type:** online, open book

*he exam covers 12 domains:
- **Cloud computing concepts & architectures:** shared responsibility, deployment models, what changes when infra is abstracted
- **Cloud governance and strategies:** policy, guardrails, operating model, ownership and accountability
- **Risk, audit, and compliance, organization management:** control mapping, evidence, audits, and how to reason about risk in cloud environments
- **Identity and access management:** identity-first thinking, least privilege, access patterns that go wrong in cloud
- **Security monitoring:** logging, visibility expectations, what “good” monitoring looks like conceptually
- **Infrastructure & networking:** network segmentation concepts, connectivity, common cloud network security themes
- **Cloud workload security:** workload protections, runtime considerations, what shifts between VMs/containers/serverless
- **Data security:** classification, encryption concepts, key management themes, data exposure risks
- **Application security:** secure design concepts and the common failure modes when apps move fast in cloud
- **Incident response & reliance:** response planning, recovery expectations, and continuity thinking in cloud
- **elated technologies & strategies:** broader ecosystem concepts that support cloud security decisions

If you’re newer to cloud, this can feel like a helpful overview/guideline. If you’ve already been working cloud environments, this is all recap.

## Who should take it
The CCSK is a good fit if you want a structured, vendor-agnostic foundation and you’re early in your cloud journey.

This exam makes sense for security professionals moving into cloud, people who need structured learning, and anyone who wants to build foundational knowledge.

What it won’t do, though, is substitute hands on experience or make you an engineer.

## Who should not take it
I wish someone explained this to me before I chose this cert: If you already have meaningful exposure to cloud security (coursework, job), you will probably find the CCSK too easy and too high level to justify the cost and time.

Additionally, you may want to skip the CCSK if:
- You already work in cloud security and want to show execution
- You want to become a cloud security engineer (do labs and implementation practice instead)
- You’re looking for a stand out cert that hiring managers look for

In my case, I had cloud security electives in my master’s program and cloud exposure at work. So the CCSK felt like reinforcement of the basics more than diving deeper into cloud.

This is not a knock on the cert, it just is more of a fundamentals test.

## How I’d approach it differently next time
I waited until the final week before the exam voucher expired and crammed. Life happens, but I wouldn’t recommend that approach.

If I did it again, I’d keep it simple: start earlier, use the practice questions, don’t overthink the prep.

## TLDR
Take the CCSKv5 if you want a vendor-agnostic general cloud security foundation and you’re newer to cloud.
Skip it if you already have cloud security experience (do labs instead).
