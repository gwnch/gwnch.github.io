excerpt: "A brief summary and reflections on the books I read in 2025 where I explored fiction for the first time in years."

In 2025 I started tracking what I read more intentionally. I also branched out into more fiction than usual as I typically stick to self help, economics, and books bout strategy and patterns. Looking back at this year’s list, a few themes show up clearly: identity, grief, and the relationship between control and agency.

## The full list (in no particular order)
** One Hundred Years of Solitude **
A book that feels like its own corner of the world with time loops and repeating history. It’s very dense, but in a way where you get absorbed and don’t realize how deep you are.

** The let Them Theory **
A great lesson on boundaries and learning to stop allowing what others do control you. Simple framing techniques that are effective in various scenarios.

** A Spy in the House of Love **
Very messy and uncomfortable. The writing actually made me feeling anxious for her and didn’t offer any closure (which was intended).

** The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo **
A airplane read that I sped through because it was so readable. It asks big questions about image and truth that I didn’t expect.

** Crying in H Mart **
This one hurt my heart. The way grief is written felt so real and precisely described. The connection to food and memories hit home.

** The Stranger **
Maybe my third or fourth read. It’s simply a great, minimalist book about performative behavior.

** Never Split the Difference **
Jamie Dimon recommended this to the interns when I was at JPMorgan Chase. Practical negotiation advice that changes how to approach conversations and asking questions. 

** The Bell Jar **
Not much to say here - it’s a great book.

** Children of the Albatross **
Feels light hearted with a dark shadow underneath the surface. Just great writing, what can I say.

** I Who Have Never Known Men** 
I feel haunted by this book. Could also write multiple essays on it.

** Cudi: The Kid Cudi Memoir **
Highly recommendation the audio book read by Cudi. A very candid book on mental health that doesn’t romanticize his struggles.

** Things in Nature Merely Grow **
Very reflective with no real plot, but lots of observations and commentary about life.

** Dark Matter **
I almost wish this book didn’t end. It’s thrilling, emotional, and surprising in a pleasant way.

** Kasher in the Rye **
A great recommendation by a friend. Would recommend the audio book read by the author. He brings the book and humor to life in ways the pages cannot.

** The Psychology of Money **
A good reset going into the new year, forcing me to examine my own assumptions. My brother has been pushing me to read this book for years and I would also recommend it.

##  What I’m taking into 2026
- I want to read more books that challenge my ideas and scare me a little (in a good way)
- I want to pick up at least a couple books on leadership, management, or productivity (I can already think of a few books)
